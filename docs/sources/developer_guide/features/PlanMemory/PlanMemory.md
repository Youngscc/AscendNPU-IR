# Plan Memory

This document describes the **PlanMemory** transformation (`PlanMemoryPass`) in HIVM: hardware context, algorithm, interface, and constraints.

## 1. Hardware background

Ascend on-chip memory uses a buffer model. It includes storage for the Cube (matrix) and Vector units. Software must control addresses explicitly and respect alignment.

For Atlas A2 training/inference products, the hardware layout<sup>[1]</sup> is:

Buffer alignment requirements:

| Buffer | Alignment | Role |
|--------|-----------|------|
| Unified Buffer (UB) | 32 bytes | General cache for vector/scalar ops |
| L1 Buffer | 32 bytes | Temporary feature maps, convolution data |
| L0A Buffer | 512 bytes | Left matrix (e.g. feature map) for matrix ops |
| L0B Buffer | 512 bytes | Right matrix (e.g. weight) for matrix ops |
| L0C Buffer | 512 bytes | Matrix op intermediate and output |
| BT Buffer | 64 bytes | BiasTable for matrix bias |
| FP Buffer | 64 bytes | Fixpipe: quantization/ReLU parameters, etc. |

## 2. Algorithm

### 2.1 Software context

In the input IR, `memref.alloc` buffers have a name and size but no address. The AscendNPU IR memory module (PlanMemory) assigns addresses based on **lifetime** to avoid overwrites and precision issues. To fit all buffers in limited on-chip memory, PlanMemory performs **memory reuse** using IR semantics and hardware rules. To avoid unnecessary data dependencies that hurt performance, it uses a **three-level allocation** strategy to balance performance and utilization.

Allocation targets the storage used by Cube (L1, L0A, L0B, L0C, etc.) and Vector (UB). Cube uses L0A/L0B for left/right matrices (loaded from L1) and L0C for results; allocation is mainly for L1 and L0C. Vector uses UB for inputs and outputs. PlanMemory also allocates a small amount of **Workspace** (`memref_ext.alloc_workspace`) for CV flows (e.g. moving Cube results from L0C to UB via workspace). Workspace size is reported to the framework runtime.

### 2.2 Terms

- **BufferLife**: The **lifetime** of a buffer — from first write (gen) to last read (kill). Non-overlapping lifetimes can share the same memory; PlanMemory computes offsets so non-overlapping buffers reuse space.
- **Alias**: Two values that refer to the same underlying data (e.g. before/after `subview`).
- **Inplace reuse**: An op’s **output** can overwrite an **input** buffer (e.g. `vcast` f16→i16 same width). PlanMemory assigns the same offset to such output under hardware inplace rules.
- **Address offset / pointer_cast**: After allocation, instead of a separate alloc, PlanMemory emits `hivm.hir.pointer_cast(offset)` (byte offset in that memory space).

---

### 2.3 Implementation

**Source**: `bishengir/lib/Dialect/HIVM/Transforms/PlanMemory.cpp`

Main steps:

- **Lifetime analysis**: For each buffer, compute gen and kill.
- **Allocation**: Assign addresses from lifetime and reuse rules.
- **OP rewrite**: Replace original `alloc` with `hivm.hir.pointer_cast(offset)`.

#### 2.3.1 Lifetime analysis

1. Use community `Liveness` for liveness.
2. Walk the IR (including scf.for, scf.if, scf.while), collect **gen** (buffers defined) and **kill** (last use) per op to get BufferLife.
3. Compute **lifetime** per buffer (first write to last read). Non-overlapping lifetimes may share memory.
4. Use Alias to identify **inplace** candidates and assign the same base address where valid.

#### 2.3.2 Allocation

Two modes: **sequential** and **reuse**. If the sum of buffer sizes fits in a Memory Scope (e.g. UB, L1), sequential allocation is used. Otherwise, reuse is applied so that reuse does not cause conflicts.

Reuse includes **Inplace** and **three-level reuse**.

##### 2.3.2.1 Inplace

Conditions: same Memory Scope (e.g. UB); in an `A = B + C` pattern, A’s kill is C’s gen; and hardware inplace rules are satisfied.

##### 2.3.2.2 Three-level reuse

The compiler tries higher levels first and rolls back to a lower level if allocation fails.

**[1] Level2**

Different pipelines (PIPE) run in parallel. Reusing memory across pipelines can add dependencies and hurt throughput. Level2: prefer reuse within the same pipeline type (e.g. Vector with Vector), so non-DMA pipelines reuse first.

Example:

```text
Shared A [A0, A1]
Shared B [B]
Shared C [C]
Shared D [D0, D1]
Loop i:
  // sync
  op1(A0, A1) // DMA OP, Double Buffer
  op2(B)      // Vector OP
  op3(C)      // Vector OP
  op4(D0, D1) // DMA OP, Double Buffer
```

With double buffering, A and D use two buffers each for DMA. When shared memory is tight, reusing C with A would introduce an extra dependency between op1 (DMA PIPE) and op3 (Vector PIPE), so MTE_PIPE and V_PIPE could not run in parallel and performance would drop.

With Level2, C reuses B; both are Vector ops, so V_PIPE is serial anyway and reuse does not add cross-pipeline dependency.

![](./Level2.png)

- Pros: Same-pipeline reuse does not add cross-pipeline dependency; better overall performance.
- Cons: Smaller reuse space; reuse may fail more often.

**[2] Level1**

Double buffering improves overlap of load and compute and is important for performance. If a single buffer reuses one slot of a double buffer, the double buffer cannot run in parallel and the pipeline stalls. Level1: in the same loop, if a single buffer would reuse a double buffer, the single buffer is upgraded to a double buffer so both slots can be used without stalling.

Example:

```text
Shared A [A0, A1]
Shared B [B]
Shared C [C]
Shared D [D0, D1]
Loop i:
  // sync
  op1(A0, A1) // DMA OP, Double Buffer
  op2(B)      // Vector OP
  op3(C)      // Vector OP
  op4(D0, D1) // DMA OP, Double Buffer
```

With double buffering, A and D use two buffers each. When shared memory is tight, if C (single buffer) reuses one slot of A, then op1 needs A0 while op3 still holds C (same as A0), so op1 must wait for op3 and the pipeline stalls.

With Level1, C is upgraded to a double buffer; op1 uses A0 while op3 uses C1 (backed by A1), so op1 does not wait for op3 and the pipeline can overlap.

![](./Level1.png)

- Pros: Avoids pipeline stall in double-buffer scenarios.
- Cons: Extra buffer for the new double buffer; may reduce reuse success rate.

**[3] Level0**

Level0: any two buffers with non-overlapping lifetimes can share memory.

![](./Level0.png)

- Pros: Maximum reuse.
- Cons: Ignores pipeline structure; bad reuse can hurt performance.

#### 2.3.3 OP rewrite

After computing offsets, replace `memref_ext.alloc_workspace` (GLOBAL_WORKSPACE_PLAN) and `memref.alloc` (LOCAL_MEM_PLAN) with `hivm.hir.pointer_cast(offset)`.

### 2.4 Tests

**File**: `bishengir/test/Dialect/HIVM/plan-memory.mlir`

**Typical CHECK**:

```mlir
// CHECK-NOT: memref.alloc()
// CHECK: %[[CONST0:.*]] = arith.constant 0 : i64
// CHECK: {{.*}} = hivm.hir.pointer_cast(%[[CONST0]])
```

## 3. Interface

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `-mem-plan-mode=global-work-space-plan` | false | Use `GLOBAL_WORKSPACE_PLAN` in CV pipeline |
| `enable-global-workspace-reuse` | false | Reuse buffers inside workspace |
| `restrict-inplace-as-isa` | false | Restrict inplace to match ISA behavior |

---

## 4. Constraints

**The total size of buffers live at any one time must not exceed the actual hardware memory size for that scope.**

> Each buffer is aligned as in [1. Hardware background](#1-hardware-background).

Otherwise, PlanMemory fails with a scope overflow error (e.g. `UB overflow`):
