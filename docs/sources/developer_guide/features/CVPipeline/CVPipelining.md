# Cube–Vector software pipelining

This document describes the **CV Pipelining** pass in HIVM. It optimizes CV-style kernels. Before reading, we recommend [CV Optimization](../CV/CVOptimization) for CV terminology.

---

## Overview

It optimizes loops in Mix kernels where multiple Cube and Vector instructions depend on each other (e.g. FlashAttention). By running Vector and Cube in parallel, it improves hardware utilization (ILP) and performance.

The pass uses multi-buffering, which can increase UB usage; tune the number of pipeline stages for your workload.

## Interface

### Compile options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `set-workspace-multibuffer` | 2 | Number of software pipeline stages and multi-buffering count |

---

## Algorithm

The pass finds suitable `scf.for` loops, splits Cube and Vector into separate work items, sets up data dependencies, expands tensors that need multi-buffering, unrolls the loop, and places each work item in its own loop.

Before:

```
scf.for 0 to N step S {
    %c = Cube() : tensor<16x16xf32>
    %v = Vector(%c) : tensor<16x16xf32>
    %c1 = Cube(%v) : tensor<16x16xf32>
    %v1 = Vector(%c1) : tensor<16x16xf32>
}
```

After:

```
scf.for 0 to N step 3*S {
    %c = scf.for 0 to 3 -> tensor<3x16x16xf32> {
        Cube();
        tensor.insert_slice
    } {cube_loop}
    %v = scf.for 0 to 3 -> tensor<3x16x16xf32> {
        %c_slice = extract_slice %c
        Vector(%c_slice) : tensor<16x16xf32>
        tensor.insert_slice
    } {vector_loop}
    %c1 = scf.for 0 to 3 -> tensor<3x16x16xf32> {
        %v_slice = extract_slice %v
        Cube(%v_slice) : tensor<16x16xf32>
        tensor.insert_slice
    } {cube_loop}
    // When no other Work Item needs the result, no buffer expansion needed
    %v1 = scf.for 0 to 3 -> tensor<16x16xf32> {
        %c_slice = extract_slice %c1
        Vector(%c_slice) : tensor<16x16xf32>
    } {vector_loop}
}
```

## Constraints

1. Only `scf.for` and `scf.if` in the pipelined loop may have regions/blocks, and each region must contain only Cube or only Vector instructions.
2. Cross-iteration dependencies must be separable into distinct work items.
   - CV-pipelining is not applied when `v0` and `v1` cannot be in the same work item (due to a Cube between them) but `arg0` is defined in `v1` and used by `v0`.
   - If Cube does not use `v0`, `v0` is placed in the same work item as `v1` and CV-pipelining applies.

```
scf.for iter_args(%arg0 = %init) {
    %v0 = Vector(%arg0)
    %c = Cube(%v0)
    %v1 = Vector(%c)
    yield %v1
}
```
